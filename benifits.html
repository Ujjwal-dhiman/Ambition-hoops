    <p style="line-height: 1.6;">If you’re looking for a physical activity to get your child off the
couch, basketball is a sport that your boy or girl can start at an
early age.
So, in what ways can your child benefit from playing basketball?
1. Gives Complete Physical Exercise
Basketball is a brisk sport, involving a lot of running, jumping,
dribbling the ball, passing it and shooting it. If your kid’s disinterest
in playing sports is visible along with problems like dullness/
laziness or weight issues that are bothering you, then Basketball is
a good option, as the continuous movements in the sport help burn
calories and lose fat.
2. Builds up Muscles
As this sport involves lot of swift movement and rigorous use of the
entire body and muscles and limbs; it will help in toning the body
and building muscles in the arms, thighs and calf areas. Your
growing boys would so love the idea of flaunting some muscles,
likewise your girls will be only too happy to tone their body.
3. Improves Height
For generations now, it’s been said that basketball will make you
grow taller. While it’s the natural genes that determine the height of
every person, a sport like basketball definitely aids growth. The
main body movement, the frequency of movement and the act of
jumping while playing the sport have scientifically shown evidence
to aid growing children in improving their height
4. Increases Accuracy &amp; Precision
Shooting the ball into the hoop requires immense concentration, a
good aim and great accuracy, all of which can be achieved through
a lot of practice. Learning to target and building precision is a life-
long skill that your child can benefit from.
5. Inculcates Self-Discipline

Just like every other sport, basketball has a number of rules to
follow. And if not followed, that will lead to penalties. So it’s a good
way for your child to appreciate the importance of following rules
and developing competitive spirit while doing so.
6. Teaches Strategy
Every sport involves certain sure fire strategies to score and win.
The dribbling and passing techniques and shooting tips make
basketball a very strategic game to play. This is again another
essential skill your child can learn as a life lesson
7. Instils Team Work
Basketball is a wonderful sport to learn to interact and operate in a
team and jointly come up with winning plans and tactics. Working
as a team while playing is the best way for them to appreciate and
adopt team spirit.
8. Helps Make New Friends
We often hear our children saying “I don’t have any friends”. This
happens when the child resists from going out of home and getting
involved in outdoor sports and activities. Being part a sports team,
especially with a game like Basketball that requires a minimum of 5
players on each side, will automatically ensure that your child
socializes well and make good friends along the way.
9. Boosts Confidence
Every time your child shoots the ball into the hoop, it will shoot up
his self-confidence by leaps and bounds. Their confidence will
greatly improve as they gain control over the ball and the strategy
of the game, which will reflect in their overall personality.
10. Motor Skills
Learning to play basketball involves dribbling, throwing, catching
and pivoting. Beginning basketball training at a young age improves
gross motor skills by using major muscle groups. Young children
who play basketball improve flexibility and endurance. Your child

will also benefit from improved fine motor skills, such as hand-eye
coordination. These motor skills transfer to other activities of daily
life.
11. Psychological Development
Becoming involved with basketball at an early age helps kids
develop psychologically. Playing on a team allows your child to
make friends and feel involved with her peer group. Team sports
also improve a child’s ability to communicate and solve basic
problems. Experiencing the benefits and difficulties of healthy
competition at a young age prepare children for failures later in life.
Basketball teaches children social skills and coping strategies that
are useful at school, home and in peer relationships.
 
You already know that Basketball are beneficial for your physical
health. But there’s more good news. In recent years, research has
also found that Basketball can positively affect your mental health.
Here’s how.
1. Improve your mood
Want a burst of happiness and relaxation? Get involved in
Basketball. Playing Basketball triggers brain chemicals that make
you feel happier and more relaxed. Basketball also provide social
benefits by allowing you to connect with teammates and friends in a
recreational setting.
2. Improve your concentration
Regularly playing Basketball helps keep your key mental skills
sharp as you age. This includes critical thinking, learning, and using
good judgment. Research has shown that doing a mix of aerobic and
muscle-strengthening activities as happen in Basketball is
especially helpful. Participating in this kind of activity three to five
times a week for at least 30 minutes can provide these mental
health benefits.

3 Reduce stress and depression
When you are physically active, your mind is distracted from daily
stressors. This can help you avoid getting bogged down by negative
thoughts. Exercise reduces the levels of stress hormones in your
body. At the same time, it stimulates production of endorphins.
These are natural mood lifters that can keep stress and depression
at bay. Endorphins may even leave you feeling more relaxed and
optimistic after a hard workout. Experts agree that more quality
research is needed to determine the relationship between sports
and depression.
4. Improve sleep habits
Playing Basketball improve the quality of sleep. They do this by
helping you fall asleep faster and deepening your sleep. Sleeping
better can improve your mental outlook the next day, as well as
improve your mood.
5. Basketball help you maintain a healthy weight
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend
sports participation as a healthy way to maintain weight. Sports like
Basketball is particularly effective ways to burn calories. Staying
within a recommended weight range reduces the likelihood of
developing diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension
6. Basketball boost your self-confidence
The regular exercise that comes with playing Basketball can boost
your confidence and improve your self-esteem. As your strength,
skills, and stamina increase through playing Basketball, your self-
image will improve as well. With the renewed vigor and energy that
comes from physical activity, you may be more likely to succeed in
tasks off the playing field as well as on it.
7. Basketball have been linked to leadership traits
Team sports like basketball are breeding grounds for leadership
traits. Studies done in high schools reveal a correlation between
sports participation and leadership qualities. Because of the

opportunity to train, try, win, or lose together, people involved in
sports are naturally more inclined to adopt a “team mindset” in the
workplace and in social situations. The team mindset leads to
strong leadership qualities over time.</p>
